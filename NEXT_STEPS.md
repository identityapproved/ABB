# Next Steps Checklist

Some tasks intentionally require manual follow-up after ABB finishes provisioning. Keep this reference handy after reconnecting as your managed user.

## AIDE Baseline

1. Review `/etc/aide.conf` and adjust any paths or exclusions you need.
2. Validate the configuration syntax:
   ```bash
   sudo aide -D
   ```
3. Seed the database (this can take several minutes on large filesystems):
   ```bash
   sudo aide --init
   ```
4. Promote the generated database:
   ```bash
   sudo mv /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new.gz /var/lib/aide/aide.db.gz
   ```
5. For recurring integrity checks:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable --now aidecheck.timer
   ```
   Inspect results with `sudo journalctl -abu aidecheck` or `/var/log/aide.log`.

## ProjectDiscovery via pdtm

ABB installs `pdtm` but does not auto-install every ProjectDiscovery binary. After your shell picks up the new PATH entries (`source ~/.bashrc` or start a new session), run:
```bash
PATH="$HOME/.pdtm/go/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" pdtm install --force subfinder dnsx naabu httpx nuclei uncover cloudlist proxify tlsx notify chaos-client shuffledns mapcidr interactsh-client interactsh-server katana
```
Repeat as needed to install additional tools announced by ProjectDiscovery.

## Docker Helpers

If you selected Docker:
- `reconftw` (wrapper at `/usr/local/bin/reconftw`) maps results to `${RECONFTW_OUTPUT:-$PWD/ReconFTW}`.
- `asnlookup` (wrapper at `/usr/local/bin/asnlookup`) uses the Docker image built from the upstream Dockerfile. Set `ASNLOOKUP_OUTPUT` to control the output directory.

Run `docker pull six2dez/reconftw:main` periodically and rebuild the Asnlookup image to stay current.
