# Next Steps Checklist

Some tasks intentionally require manual follow-up after ABB finishes provisioning. Keep this reference handy after reconnecting as your managed user.

## AIDE Baseline

1. Review `/etc/aide.conf` and adjust any paths or exclusions you need.
2. Validate the configuration syntax:
   ```bash
   sudo aide -D
   ```
3. Seed the database (this can take several minutes on large filesystems):
   ```bash
   sudo aide --init
   ```
4. Promote the generated database:
   ```bash
   sudo mv /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new.gz /var/lib/aide/aide.db.gz
   ```
5. For recurring integrity checks:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable --now aidecheck.timer
   ```
   Inspect results with `sudo journalctl -abu aidecheck` or `/var/log/aide.log`.

## ProjectDiscovery via pdtm

ABB installs `pdtm` but does not auto-install every ProjectDiscovery binary. After your shell picks up the new PATH entries (`source ~/.bashrc` or start a new session), run:
```bash
PATH="$HOME/.pdtm/go/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" pdtm install --force subfinder dnsx naabu httpx nuclei uncover cloudlist proxify tlsx notify chaos-client shuffledns mapcidr interactsh-client interactsh-server katana
```
Repeat as needed to install additional tools announced by ProjectDiscovery.

## Docker Helpers

If you selected Docker:
- `reconftw` (wrapper at `/usr/local/bin/reconftw`) keeps a pristine config at `/opt/vps-tools/reconftw/reconftw.cfg`, copies it to `${RECONFTW_CONFIG:-$HOME/.config/reconftw/reconftw.cfg}` on first run, and maps results to `${RECONFTW_OUTPUT:-$PWD/ReconFTW}` (directory created with 0777 permissions for container writes). Edit the per-user config to customise targets and modules.
- `feroxbuster` (wrapper at `/usr/local/bin/feroxbuster-docker` with alias `feroxbuster`) seeds `/opt/vps-tools/feroxbuster/ferox-config.toml`, copies it to `${FEROX_CONFIG_PATH:-$HOME/.config/feroxbuster/ferox-config.toml}` on first run, and mounts either the config file or directory into the container. Adjust the config before running long scans.
- `trufflehog-docker` (wrapper at `/usr/local/bin/trufflehog-docker`) mounts `${TRUFFLEHOG_WORKDIR:-$PWD}` to `/pwd`. If you skipped the native installation prompt, use this wrapper instead.
- `asnlookup` (wrapper at `/usr/local/bin/asnlookup`) uses the Docker image built from the upstream Dockerfile. Set `ASNLOOKUP_OUTPUT` to control the output directory.
- `cewl` (wrapper at `/usr/local/bin/cewl`) mounts `${CEWL_WORKDIR:-$PWD}` to `/host` inside the container. Use standard CeWL flags; wordlists written to `/host/...` will persist on the mounted directory.
- `amass` (wrapper at `/usr/local/bin/amass`) mounts `${AMASS_CONFIG:-$HOME/.config/amass}` into the container so configuration and data persist between runs.

Run `docker pull six2dez/reconftw:main`, `docker pull epi052/feroxbuster:latest`, and `docker pull trufflesecurity/trufflehog:latest` periodically, and rebuild the Asnlookup image to stay current.

## WireGuard Follow-Up

- Mullvad profiles generated by `mullvad-wg.sh` live in `/etc/wireguard`. After reviewing them, bring up your tunnel with `sudo wg-quick up <profile>` and confirm connectivity:
  ```bash
  curl https://am.i.mullvad.net/json | jq
  ```
- The utilities task already injects SSH-preserving `PostUp`/`PreDown` rules; adjust the port if you run SSH on a non-standard port.
